## About Laravel Bootcamp

[Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) is a guide that will walk us through building a modern Laravel application from scratch. To explore the framework, we'll build a microblogging platform called Chirper.

In addition to Laravel, you will build your front-end using Vue. We will also be digging into Inertia and Tailwind CSS.
